SecretSanta
This is a game generally played by corporate companies during the time of Christmas where each employee will be santa for other employee and child of some other employee. Santa have to give gift to his child. Child doesn't know who santa is but vice versa is possible. My application makes the process easy by randomly allocation Santa's and childs from employees and also provides awesome features like anonymous chat incase of santa to child (since child shouldn't know who his santa is!!!). So an employee can chat with his child as well as santa. Santa can assign tasks to his child and only if child is able to impress his/her santa.. then santa gives a gift to child. Not just this, but there are way many features included!!!.
